  // 1. Variants you want to activate,
  // 2. Contents for slots you want to fill,
  // 3. Overrides for any named node in the component to attach behavior and data,

  // By default, PlasmicDashboard is wrapped by your project's global

  // Next.js Custom App component
  // (https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app).
